            I’ve worked with other data science students in a real project hired by a local business. Myself and 
        others, including 10-15 individuals, worked on a database and website for Clearview, a screen and window 
        company. We used different coding languages, primarily python and SQLite for the database. For the website 
        we used HTML and CSS. Overall, the project took a little more than a year of work from various students. 
        In this data science society, I learned valuable skills in the field of coding. I also developed skills 
        that helped me work alongside others in a team setting.

            I’ve also worked for Johns Manville operating and managing machines and the factory floor. I made more 
        than 15,000 dollars for this company during my time here through the product that I reprocessed. I gained 
        technical knowledge and skills as I learned to operate different industrial-grade machines. Additionally, 
        I developed creative solutions to problems for operating and fixing machines.
