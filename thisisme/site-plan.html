      <h3>My Projects</h3>
      <p>
        In high school I remade Battleship™ using Object-Oriented Programming. I accomplished this using 
        exclusively Java. I used 2D Arrays to map out the grid. I also learned to practice good OOP practice by 
        using polymorphism and encapsulation. This was my first significant project. 

        Additionally, also using Java, I redesigned the famous card game, Blackjack. Without the use of real money,
        it allows the user to simulate a realistic game of Blackjack. Using random number generators and a fairly 
        simple computer, this project was not only fun to build, but very fun to practice and play as a result.

        There are many more projects that I want to finish during my time as a computer science student. A project 
        I’m currently studying and working towards is an advanced personal planner. Inspired by an app used in my 
        previous work experience, Area Book, I want to create an app that can not only organize personal goals and 
        plans, but also track important information. This information can prove helpful for call centers, sales 
        companies, and any individual that wants to improve their quality of life. Each person’s potential is 
        influenced by their ability to set a vision and goals for themselves. This app will help them realize their 
        aspirations and become the best version of themselves.

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve worked with other data science students in a real project hired by a local business. Myself and 
        others, including 10-15 individuals, worked on a database and website for Clearview, a screen and window 
        company. We used different coding languages, primarily python and SQLite for the database. For the website 
        we used HTML and CSS. Overall, the project took a little more than a year of work from various students. 
        In this data science society, I learned valuable skills in the field of coding. I also developed skills 
        that helped me work alongside others in a team setting. 


	      I’ve grown my ability to teach and socialize during my time as a missionary in Arkansas, Missouri, and 
        Oklahoma. I organized many trainings and even organized routes and plans for transporting missionaries to 
        different areas within our assigned “mission”. I developed a variety of valuable skills that will help me 
        in this setting. I work well with others in demanding situations.

	      I’ve also worked for Johns Manville operating and managing machines and the factory floor. I made more 
        than 15,000 dollars for this company during my time here through the product that I reprocessed. I gained 
        technical knowledge and skills as I learned to operate different industrial-grade machines. Additionally, 
        I developed creative solutions to problems for operating and fixing machines.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in Ohio as the seventh child of a family of eight. I was raised in a family that taught me important values and morals. 
        I’ve developed a strong work ethic and sense of individual value. I've always been fascinated by all things science and have come across
        overbearing to my family at times with how much I love sharing science. I've been intrigued by the potential of
        programming and the endless opportunities and creations to be had in this profession.

        This will be an about me page. The six pictures of food in the wireframe will be replaced with different 
        pictures related to me and my family. I only have two pages here for now. But I'm looking for more to add right now.
